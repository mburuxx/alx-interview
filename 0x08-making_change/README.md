### Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- Implement the coin change problem using greedy algorithms.
- Implement the coin change problem using dynamic programming.
- Analyze and compare the efficiency of different approaches.
- Understand and apply algorithmic complexity analysis.

- Directory: `0x08-making_change`

## Tasks
* [0-making_change.py](./0-making_change.py)
<br>In `0-making_change.py`, implement the `makeChange` function to find the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given total amount using a list of coin denominations.

## Requirements
General:
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- All your files must be executable

### Prototype:
```python
def makeChange(coins, total):
    pass
```
